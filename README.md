CeleraOne test project

#Journey
Completed the entire task less than 8 hours. I can also achieve the similar feat with REACTJS,ANGULARJS.
Using pure javascript is interesting(Jquery would make easy). I loved working on this And I strongly believe this "Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand" -Martin Fowler. statement and do the work in same passion. So I have added comments describing my code wherever possible.

Since javscript does not have one methodology to detect data type(we have typeof,instanceof etc), I have used various methods to detect data type for sorting the columns.

#Getting Started
